 -title: Pocketcasts for Android Review (April 2017)
 ----
 -
 -My requisites for a podcast app is a good interface, dark mode, autodownloading, a way to speed things up, and a way to listen to my audiobooks. Most podcast apps nails a lot of those things I just mentioned except for the first one or the last one. That's why after using pocketcasts for more than a year, I'm going to go through its many virtues and my nitpicky annoyances.
 -
 -Pocketcasts is straightforward, when you open the app, your next actions are clear, subscribe to an app from their recommendations or search through their database. 
-
 -The first time I installed the app, I immediately checked the settings and switched to the dark theme. I've always used pocketcasts in dark theme and I forget that it's not the default. Why even use the light theme?
 -
 -Let's start with the now playing interface, the buttons are nice, big, and configurable (settings), and it has chapters support:

 -
 -If you tap the bottom left corner, you'll get audio effects to increase playback speed, a trim silence feature, and a volume boosting feature. Also accessible from the now playing screen is a sleep timer. 
 -
 -Pocketcasts also has filters you can set, they're like lists of podcasts with special rules that you customize, like show only downloaded episodes in this filter, or auto-download all the podcasts in this filter. You can also 
 -'star' your favorite podcast episodes.

 -
 -You can listen to audiobooks in Pocketcasts, technically any mp3 file, including songs will work, why you would do that, I don't know. You just need to enable a custom folder in the settings and it will show you the file path where you can add mp3 files. Press sync and a folder icon will appear in your podcast collection, with the mp3s you added.
 -
 -Now for some miscellaneous features, syncing is done automatically and in the background, this is for checking new episodes from your subscriptions and syncing to other Pocketcasts apps you might be using too (web, iOS). The app also tracks your listening stats. The app is simple to use but configurable if you want options. You can import and export lists of podcasts.
 -
 -Now for some nitpicks, each time I add mp3s to the custom folder, they're all marked as starred. And the sleep timer needs a 10 minutes option. I can't be the only one who thinks 5 minutes is too short but 15 minutes is too long, and I know I can set the minutes but it would be better if it's only 1 tap away and it doesn't turn off my bluelight filter momentarily when I set the minutes. I know, they're nitpicks.
 -
 -To end this post, I like to mention that the app is stable. This is the app I recommend when people ask for a good podcast app. It has all the features I want, and then some. I've also compiled screenshots of all the options in the settings for the people who want to know all the configurables below.
