title: The Blog

This site is a project to improve my writing. My grammar and spelling are degrading. I'm less concerned about prose because it was barely there to begin with. I'm doing this blog to make me write more often. I just need to increase the volume of my writing so I can improve it. 

I'm going to post something daily. The quality of the blog posts will be very wonky. I like to think of this as my own "daily vlog".
